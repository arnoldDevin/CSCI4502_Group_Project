## Project Description
We sought out to prove that successful businesses have more in common than just good service. Using association rules, clustering, decision trees, confusion matrices, and built in python tools, we were able to determine what sucessful businesses have in common, what uncommon businesses have in common, and how the two differ. We used a data set provided by kaggle and yelp.
