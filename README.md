## Project Description
We sought out to prove that successful businesses have more in common than just good service. Using association rules, clustering, decision trees, confusion matrices, and built in python tools, we were able to determine what successful businesses have in common, what uncommon businesses have in common, and how the two differ. Our primary data set is provided by kaggle and yelp, the files included are as follows:

yelp_business.csv,
yelp_business_attributes.csv, yelp_checkins.csv, and
yelp_business_hours.csv

Our secondary data set which is integrated with the primary data set is titled MedianZip-3.xlsx which has been integrated with yelp_business.csv to make yelp_money_merge.csv. This file was used to make to create a map of the Phoenix area mean income distribution.
